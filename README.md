# What is this?
This site, and this markdown document, were among some of my first exercices as a web developer. We had to write a markdown document (this one) and then create it in HTML / CSS with some added effects. The whole thing went pretty well, I had a lot of fun.

# Me, Myself, and I - A little bit about myself
---
What do I look like ? Well, I look like this...

## This is my first page written in Markdown !

At first, let me give you my favorite latin quote that summarizes my train of thought pretty well:
>Docendo discimus

It means *"By teaching, we learn"*. It's a quote I try to live by.

## Some code
Since I'm here to study web development let me give you an example of two things I use for that:

#### Javascript (ECMAscript)

    console.log('Hello, world');

*This code prints 'Hello, world' to the console.*

#### HTML

    <p>I LOVE PEARL JAM !</p>

*This code prints out 'I LOVE PEARL JAM' in your web browser.*
